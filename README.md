*Project Title: Quiz Game*

For this project, we decided to create a quiz game where users answer questions, inspired by websites like Kahoot. We chose this project as a way to learn and practice coding. Initially, we werenâ€™t sure what to do, but we found the idea of a quiz game interesting and not too complicated, so we decided to go with it and learn from online resources.

While working on this project, we faced many challenges, especially because we chose to use a new programming language. It was difficult to know where to start, and we struggled with understanding the structure. However, we learned a lot by using online resources like YouTube and W3Schools, and we also got help from ChatGPT to fix our code. 

Even though we had assistance, we gained valuable experience from this project. We now have a better understanding of how the structure of this project works and how to add background or audio and more like design with CSS, and we know how HTML links to JavaScript and CSS, which were new to us. We consider this project a significant learning experience and an improvement in our skills
